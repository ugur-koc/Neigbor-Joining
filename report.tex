\section{Introduction}

Neighbor-joining algorithm (NJ) is a widely used algorithm for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from evolutionary distance data. The method takes a greedy bottom-up approach, iteratively joining pairs of taxonomic units that minimizes pre-computed distances. In this work, we present our C++ implementation of the algorithm. We compare the running time of the implementation with other popular packages. In addition, we also provide a benchmark on our implementation for computing the distance matrix between sequences. We found that BLAH BLAH.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Hierarchical clustering}

\subsection{Phylogenetic trees}

\end{figure}

Phylogenetic trees are branching diagrams that show the evolutionary relationships between biological species. A weighted phylogenetic tree, with weights associated with its edges, captures the notion of genetic distances between species. By analyzing a weighted phygenetic tree, we understand not only \textit{how} but also \textit{how much} species are related to or different from one another. Figure \ref{fig:phytree} \footnote{Image taken from \url{http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/how_to_read_a_phylogeny}} features an artificial phylogentic tree of 10 viruses. Each virus is represented by a leave in the tree. Each internal node marks a milestone when a genetic divergence occurs. The lengths of the horizontal lines represent time periods. For instance, we can see that the divergence between virus 1 and virus 2 occurs before the divergence between virus 3 and virus 4. Phylogentic trees can be constructed from various distance metrics. In this example, the metric assigned to the edges is the proportion of substitutions occuring on a sequence (the number of substituions divided by the length of the sequence). 

\subsection{Neighbor-joining algorithm}

We consider the problem of constructing a phylogentic tree from a set of protein sequences given their distance data. There are many approaches to tackle this problem. One approach frames the problem as as a hierarchical clustering problem, which has been extensively studied in the fields of data mining or machine learning and has efficient solutions using statistical models. Although statistical approaches methods have been employed to build these complex evolution trees, classical approaches such as the NJ algorithm has the advantage of being easy to implement and scalable to large datasets. 

Figure \ref{alg:nj} summarizes the NJ algorithm. The input for the NJ algorithm are a set $P$ of sequences (usually DNA or protein sequences) and a distance matrix $D$ where each entry is the distance between a pair of sequences. The NJ algorithm constructs the phylogentic tree from bottom up, going from leaves to root. It starts with a forest of $N$ single-node trees, each of which represents a sequence. In each later step, the algorithm selects two trees in the forest, joins them into a single tree by connecting their roots to a newly formed root. This process repeats until there is only tree left in the forest.

In an intermediate step, the algorithm decides which two trees to join by computing a \textit{branch length} matrix $L$ based on the distance matrix $D$. The branch length matrix contains $T \times T$ entries, where $T$ is the number of trees in the forest at the current step. Each entry of the matrix is computed as follows:  
\begin{equation}
  L_{i, j} = (T - 2) D_{i, j} - \sum_{k \in R}^n (D_{i, k} + D_{j, k})
  \label{eqn:branch}
\end{equation} where $R$ is the set of tree roots in the current forest.

Next, the algorithm selects the pair ($x$, $y$) with the highest branching length and connects each node to a new root, say $u$. The distances between u and x, y are:  
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  & D_{u, x}^{'} = \frac{1}{2} D_{x, y} + \frac{1}{2(T - 2)} \left[ \sum_{k \in R} (D_{x, k} - D_{y, k}) \right] 
\\  
& D_{u, y}^{'} = D_{x, y} - D_{u, x}^{'}
\end{split}
\label{eqn:distance_joined}
\end{equation}

We also update the distances between $u$ and other roots:
\begin{equation}
  D_{u, z}^{'} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ D_{x, z} + D_{y, z} - D_{x, y} \right], \ \ \ \text{for} \ z \neq x, y
\label{eqn:distance_nonjoined}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Function{Neighor-joining}{$P$, $D$}
      \State $T \leftarrow \varnothing$ 
      \State $R \leftarrow P$

        \State $T \leftarrow |R|$
        \For {$(i, j) \in R \times R$}
          \State Compute $L_{i, j}$ using equation \ref{eqn:branch}. 
        \EndFor
        \State $(x, y) \leftarrow \arg \max L$
        \State Create new root $u$.
        \State Compute $D^{'}$ from $u$ to other nodes using equations \ref{eqn:distance_joined} and \ref{eqn:distance_nonjoined}.
        \State $D \leftarrow D^{'}$
        \State $T \leftarrow T \cup \{(u, x, D_{u, x}), (u, y, D_{u, y})\}$
        \State $R \leftarrow R \cup \{u\} \setminus \{x, y\}$
      \EndFor
    \State Let $u, v$ be the only two elements left in $R$.
    \State $T \leftarrow T \cup \{(u, v, D_{u, v})\}$
    \Return $T$
   \EndFunction

\subsection{Computing distance matrix}

Neighbor-joining algorithm is deterministic, i,e, given a distance matrix it will always produce the same phylogenetic three. Therefore achieving accurate results highly depend on the model of evaluation, i,e, distance matrix.
We have used two packages to compute distance matrix. For already aligned sequences, we used the package emboss\footnote{\url{http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.6/emboss/apps/distmat.html}} \cite{rice2000emboss}. Emboss has \textit{distmat} program, which computes distance matrix for already aligned sequences. We wrote a wrapper script in perl to call this program and then post process it's output in order to put it in the format of input distance matrix of our NJ implementation (see \textit{aligntodist.pl} script in source code).

\textit{distmat} has tree different multiple substitution correction methods implemented for aligned proteins sequences. They are Uncorrected, Jukes-Cantor~\cite{jukes1969evolution}, and Kimura Protein~\cite{kimura1980simple}. 

To compute distance matrix for a set of protein sequences we used \textit{protdist} program from phylib\footnote{\url{http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html}} package~\cite{plotree1989phylip}. We slightly modified the source code in order to have the output in required format and we removed the unnecessary functionality which does not matter for this project (see \textit{protdist.c} source file for details).

\textit{protdist} has five method for amino-acid substitutions. They are Dayhoff PAM matrix~\cite{kosiol2005different}, Jones-Taylor-Thornton model (JTT)~\cite{jones1992rapid}, PMB (Probability Matrix from Blocks) model~\cite{veerassamy2003transition}, Kimura's distance~\cite{kimura1983rare}, and Categories distance\footnote{See \url{http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html}}

\section{Experiment}

To evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our implementations, we conducted a set of experiments. 

We first aimed at generating accurate phylogenetic tree trying out different evaluation models when generating the distance matrix. We then compared our results with some other popular implementations of neighbor-joining algorithm. 

In these experiments, effectiveness refers to the accuracy of the phylogenetic tree produced at the end, i.e. how close/similar the tree to the ground truth (we take the results in \cite{khafif2014identification} as the ground truth), and the efficiency refers to the computation time. 

\subsection{Data}

In all experiments, we used the data and results given by Khafif et. al~\cite{khafif2014identification}. 

TODO: do we have time to experiment on other data?.

\subsubsection{Study 2; Comparing with other neighbor-joining implementations}

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{runningtime.png}
  \caption{Comparison on the running times of our NJ implementation and PHYLIP's.}
  \label{fig:runningtime}
\end{figure}


We present both qualitative and quantitative comparisions between our NJ implementation and that of the PHYLIP package version 3.6 ~\cite{felsenstein2005phylip}. In terms of accuracy, our implementation produces the same phylogenetic tree on the 85VASTdomains dataset. To compare the performances of the two implementations, we measure their running times on 10 synthesized datasets, whose size vary from 100 to 1000. As seen from Figure \ref{fig:runningtime}, our implementation outperforms the PHYLIB's implemenation by a factor of approximately 2. This is a surprsing result since we do not employ any advanced optimizing techniques in our implementation. We suspect the performance gain stems from optimizing features of the new C++11 compiler (we use g++ 4.9.2 with O2 optimizer whereas the PHYLIB package uses gcc 4.9.2 with no optimizing option).  

\section{Concluding Remarks}

In this project, we implemented Neighbor-Joining algorithm and conducted experiments on a dataset of 85 protein sequences. We evaluated the effectiveness of our implementation by comparing our phylogenetic trees with the one report by Khafif et. al.~\cite{khafif2014identification}. We then evaluated the efficiency of our implementation by comparing the tree construction times with some other packages which are popular in the domain.

Our results suggest that for the dataset we worked on 1) our implementation was able to generate phylogenetic tree with high accuracy (TODO: verify and revise if necessary) and 2) our implementation did so at a fraction of time compared to the tools used in Study 2 (TODO: verify and revise if necessary).
